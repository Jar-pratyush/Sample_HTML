    <p>
      This website is designed to provide basic information about how the web
      works. It uses simple static HTML without complex styling.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1: HTML -->
    <a name="html_section"></a>
    <h2 style="color: darkblue">1. HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
      displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes and other items.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 2: The Internet -->
    <a name="internet_section"></a>
    <h2 style="color: darkblue">2. The Internet</h2>
    <p>
      The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that
      use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion
      devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions
      of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local
      to global scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and
      services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of
      the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the
      United States federal government in the 1960s to build robust,
      fault-tolerant communication via computer networks.

    <a name="protocols_section"></a>
    <h2 style="color: darkblue">3. Web Protocols</h2>
    <p>
      <b>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</b> This is the foundation of data
      communication for the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol
      for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):</b> This is an extension of
      the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is used for secure communication over
      a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</b> This is a standard network protocol
      used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a
      computer network.
